## Armstrong Level 4 – Week 15

This repository contains multiple small Node.js/Express topics organized by sections (`section1`, `section2`, `section3`) plus a larger `weekly-project`. The topics cover Socket.IO real-time communication, file streaming, and web application development.

- **Prerequisites**: Node.js (v18+ recommended) and npm installed.
- **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` inside each topic folder before running it the first time.
- **Run a topic**: From that topic folder, use `node index.js` or `node server.js` or `npm start` (if a start script exists in `package.json`).
